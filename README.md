Hi Team,

We are planning to have a new build(1.6.23) released by Tuesday, November 12th EOD.
QA can start the testing from Wednesday morning hours (IST - time zone where QA is available). 

This build addresses the following items based on the priority & valueness:
Legal changes (S4846432: Legal: Revise T&C Checkbox Label and Hyperlinks | Rally)
Graceful error message for existing customer (S4849478: Account exists error - short term solution | Rally )
Try Again button is not working (DE456711: HA: 'Try again' button is not clickable when the already registered email is used | Rally)
Query param change error page (DE456875: Application page is broken upon modifying the query parameters | Rally)
Please note that a spike will be created for the issue "plain password text is seen in network logs(payload)"  and this will worked on priority for next release.

Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns on the plan.

Thanks,
Chandra
