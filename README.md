Hi Team,

We are planning to release a new build (1.6.23) by Tuesday, November 12th, end of day. QA can start testing on Wednesday morning (IST), which aligns with the availability of our QA team.

This build addresses the following prioritized items:

Legal changes: Update T&C Checkbox Label and Hyperlinks (S4846432 | Rally)
Graceful error message: Provide clear messaging for existing accounts (S4849478 | Rally)
Try Again button fix: Make 'Try again' button clickable for previously registered emails (DE456711 | Rally)
Error handling for query parameters: Resolve error on application page when query parameters are modified (DE456875 | Rally)
Please note that we will create a spike to address the issue of plaintext passwords appearing in network logs. This will be prioritized for the next release.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns about the plan.

Thanks,
Chandra
