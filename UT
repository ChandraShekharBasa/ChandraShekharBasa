**Subject:** Release Build 1.6.24 - Ready for Testing and Deployment to STAGE

Hi Team,

We have completed all changes for the previously committed priority items, and the new release build (1.6.24) is now deployed to the STAGE environment.

During our review session, we identified and resolved the following issues:
1. The application defaults to the "Hello Alice" ("ha") theme without breaking the page when an invalid "dist" query parameter is entered.
2. Formatting adjustments on the Legal page.
3. Updates to the end-to-end subscription flow.
4. Font styling corrections for the "Terms & Conditions Apply" text in the footer.

These fixes are currently in the Development environment and need to be pushed to STAGE.

**@Praful Chandekar [C]**
The following pull requests have been merged into the Development branch. We need your assistance in moving them to STAGE after appropriate verification:
- **Pull Request #330**: E154836/bugfix/legal page formatting - Bitbucket
- **Pull Request #600**: S000/vqa query fix - Bitbucket
- **Pull Request #331**: S4842653: Updating Terms & Conditions text font size - Bitbucket

Please refer to the recording in the SBD Devs Teams group for an overview of the validation steps required before pushing these changes to STAGE.

**@Amit Balagar/@Anita Sudnye [C]**
The STAGE environment is now updated with major changes, so please begin testing and gathering evidence. All DEV-complete stories have been moved to the QA column for your reference. Once the final build is available, please complete regression testing and have all necessary items (evidence, UI automation tests) ready by 10 AM EST on Wednesday for PLL.

Please add your evidence to the PLL Confluence page: **Small and Medium Enterprises SME Biz360 MTF Hotfix Evidence Page - Production Launch List Tracking V2.2023.Q1 - Confluence**.

If any issues arise, please inform the team promptly for triage and resolution if critical.

Thanks,  
Chandra
