Hi Team,

We have completed all the changes for the committed priority items as informed earlier. 
We have the new release build(1.6.24) ready and the STAGE environment is updated with the release build.

We observed a few issues mentioned below in our review session and those issues got fixed as well.
When changing the "dist" query param with some random value, it should default to Hello alice ("ha") theme and application page should not break.
Legal page formatting issue
Update subscription end-end flow
The font styling of Terms & conditions apply text in Footer should be corrected
All these fixes are available in Development environment and we need to push them to STAGE.
@Praful Chandekar [C], Following is the PR list which are merged to Develop, and we need your help in pushing them to STAGE after proper verification.
