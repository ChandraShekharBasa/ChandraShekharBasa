Hi Amit/Anita,

We have fixed the following Mobile view priority issues that are reported.
Get in touch link is broken
Biz360 logo in header is missing in Features & Pricing pages
The changes are deployed to STAGE so please start testing these & any related use cases, run the regression suite, collect the evidences and share with them within this group.

Minisite version: 1.6.28
Component lib version: 1.3.90

Please note that these are not show stoppers for the ongoing PROD release and we are planning to provide these changes as hot fix later.

Thanks for your support.

Thanks,
Chandra
