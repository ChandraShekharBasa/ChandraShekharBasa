Initially I thought the below is the root cause after the investigation.

Hibernate attempts to insert a new KYC_ADDRESS record but encounters a duplicate identifier upon updating the "cardholder and administrator information" from UI i.e. when updating KYC_RELATED_PARTY parent table that stores/updates the KYC address into the child/associated table KYC_ADDRESS.
This is likely because Hibernate is unaware that the KYC_ADDRESS object already exists and should be updated instead of inserted.

So I made the fix and sent PR for the same: https://bitbucketdc-cluster07.jpmchase.net/projects/CBOPTIMIZER/repos/cbuo-client-onboarding-svc/pull-requests/175/overview

However, when I recheck the issue today on UAT environment after UAT DB is wiped out, I observed that the reported use case is working fine and issue is no longer seen. So issue seems be with corrupted data in DB.

Hence resolving the ticket and assigning it to Susmita for further validation.
