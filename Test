Initially I suspect the root cause of the issue was as follows.

When updating the "cardholder and administrator information" from the UI—specifically, when updating the KYC_RELATED_PARTY parent table, which stores and updates the KYC address in the associated KYC_ADDRESS child table—Hibernate attempted to insert a new KYC_ADDRESS record. This resulted in a duplicate identifier error. This likely occurred because Hibernate was not aware that the KYC_ADDRESS object already existed and should have been updated rather than inserted.

To address this, I implemented a fix and submitted a PR here: PR #175.

However, after reviewing the issue today in the UAT environment—following a UAT database reset—the reported use case appears to be functioning correctly, and the issue no longer occurs. This suggests that the problem was due to corrupted data in the database.

Therefore, I am resolving this ticket and reassigning it to Susmita for further validation.
