Hi Harsh/Abhi,

We have anticipated to complete all the changes and get the new release build by tomorrow EOD.
But due to the new stories added to the list today morning, we need some more time (may be a day) to complete everything.

This is to stabilize the deliverables instead of pushing them in rush.
Hope you understand the concern and thanks for your support.

Thanks,
Chandra
