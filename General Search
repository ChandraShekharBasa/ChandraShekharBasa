Integrate PERF Script with Jules for PERF Env


Hi Harsh,

I wanted to share my perspective on this. As far as I understand, we can consider this a low-risk issue regarding remediation since the reported issue originates from the build process (a transitive dependency in package.json) and doesnâ€™t make it into the final application package/distribution.

In such cases, we typically close the issue with relevant comments, as this does not pose a vulnerability to our application.

Thanks,
Chandra
